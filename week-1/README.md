# 📘 Machine Learning Course Roadmap

For most of this project, we will be following **MIT OpenCourseWare - 6.036: Introduction to Machine Learning**.  
This is an excellent course that builds strong intuition and fundamentals in machine learning.

## 📚 Course Outline

You should go through the following lectures in order:

- **Week 1: Basics**
  - Introduction to Machine Learning
  - Linear Classifiers
- **Week 2: Perceptrons**
- **Week 3: Features**
- **Week 4: Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent**
- **Week 5: Regression**

📌 **Course materials and video lectures** can be found here:

## 🛠️ Hands-on Tasks

After completing the lectures, proceed with the following practical work:

1. **Perceptron Notebook**
   - Open `perceptron.ipynb`
   - Complete all the missing sections
   - Experiment with different datasets  
   - Although the perceptron is a relatively simple algorithm, it is great for building intuition and experimenting with decision boundaries.

2. **Linear regression**
   - In this assignment you will have to implement linear regression using gradient descent,fill in the code snippets in the "Week1_assignment2" notebook
   - We will be using Pytorch library for this assignment , you can go through its documentation [here](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) 
   - Use the following command on the linux terminal to install the Pytorch package 
   ```
   pip install torch
   ```

3. **(To be continued…)**
   - Additional exercises and extensions will be added here.

Happy learning! 🚀  
Feel free to experiment, break things, and explore beyond the lectures.
